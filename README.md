## Upvote

Upvote is a Reddit-esque web application that allows users to create posts, upvote and downvote posts, and comment on posts in a multi-threaded, nested list.

The project is built using Next.js with the /app router and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and uses [Auth.js (formerly Next Auth)](https://authjs.dev/) for user authentication. The data is stored in a Postgres database, which is created and accessed with raw SQL queries using the `pg` package.

The project is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## Features

- [x] View a list of posts
- [x] View a single post
- [x] Create a post
- [x] Upvote and downvote posts
- [x] Pagination of posts
- [x] Comment on posts
- [x] Nested comments (recursive lists)
- [x] User authentication

## Setup instructions

1. Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - the URL of your Postgres database (eg. the Supabase connection string)
   - `AUTH_SECRET` - the Next Auth secret string (this can be anything at all like a password, but keep it secret!)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` - the GitHub OAuth client ID (create yours in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` - the GitHub OAuth client secret (create this in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers))
4. Create the database schema by running the SQL commands in `schema.sql` in your database (eg. by running the commands in Supabase Query Editor)
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site

# Reflections

## Setup

- Set up was fine, really no errors!

## auth.js

- Was stuck on this for a while, recieving an error saying "The redirect_uri is not associated with this application." I read some documentation and was starting to think it was to do with my oAuth settings. I had the callback URL as the deployment url instead of the local url, which is what I was currently working on at the time !!

## Features

- With this I belive the application is running with all of the basic features listed in the readme, and will now start working on the potential future features!!

## Fixes

- Fix page titles on post pages to match the post title ✅ ? I can't tell automatically at the beginning, but it looks done

- Handle the error when you click to vote while not logged in to show a nice error message ✅
- Added an on brand error page, with a link to the login button.
- However, if you get redirected to this from the home page, the "didit" button will not be able to redirect you to the home page.
  - If you get redirected to this from a post, this works fine

## Future Features

- Profile page: Made the link to the dynamic route, just need to fill the page.jsx

- Test
